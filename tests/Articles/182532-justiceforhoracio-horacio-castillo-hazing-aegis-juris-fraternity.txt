MANILA, Philippines - #JusticeForHoracio trends on Twitter as people condemn the gruesome death of Horacio Castillo III, a freshman law student from the University of Santo Tomas.

Castillo's body was found Sunday morning, September 17, in Tondo, Manila. He was covered in bruises, and candle wax drippings that his parents believe were a result of Aegis Juris Fraternity's initiation hazing rites.
