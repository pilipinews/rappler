MANILA, Philippines - Despite the growing need for shelter in the Philippines, the country's housing agencies are likely to get their lowest budget in a decade.

Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) Chairperson Eduardo del Rosario said that the sector will only get P4.7 billion in the proposed national budget for 2018.

The amount is around 92% lower than the P68 billion budget HUDCC requested from the Department of Budget and Management. (READ: NHA faces P10 billion cut in 2018 proposed budget (https://www.rappler.com/nation/179882-nha-cut-2018-budget-proposal))

In his presentation during the budget hearing in the Senate on Tuesday, September 26, Del Rosario emphasized that this is the lowest amount given to them in the last 10 years.

A total of P4.9 billion was allocated to housing agencies in 2008. It increased to P21 billion in 2011, and to as much as P37 billion in 2014.

Funding dropped to P15 billion in 2017, and is further reduced to P4.7 billion in the latest proposed budget.
